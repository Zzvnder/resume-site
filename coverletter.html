            <p><span>H</span>iring Manager!</p>
            <p>I am a hard-working, quick, and eager learner looking to secure a position with your team.</p>
            <p>My soft skills have been well developed in my time as an HVAC Technician where I worked in cooperation
                and communicated with management, colleagues, and customers daily, to achieve a complex outcome.
                However, I have prepared to change professions. </p>
            <p>I gained extensive practice spinning up mock networks in an organization setting. After which, I designed
                workstations with both hardware and software that had role dependent requirements. I spent a term
                working in a help-desk position where I would field inter-employee tickets, diagnose, and supply a
                most-likely solution. Towards the end of my degree, I took a web design course where I was introduced to
                front-end development. I learned quickly in HTML and CSS while developing a landing page for a mock
                business. Every day I am building skills in JavaScript to accompany my HTML, CSS, and any applications I
                may take on in the future. As we speak, I am gaining experience in building out an API based web
                application in JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In 2020, I decide to transform my passion for web development, coding/programming into a career through
                Southern Hampshire University. I aspire to continue my education and earn my bachelorâ€™s degree. </p>
            <p>I learn by doing, so, I will do. </p>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you,</p>
            <p> - Alexander Scopas</p>
