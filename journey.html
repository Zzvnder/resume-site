            <h1>My Journey</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="cover-content">
            <p>I was born in Palmer, Alaska in 1990. We moved to Michigan when I was very young where I grew up and
                graduated high school. After high school, I would move it Missouri where I lived for 4-5 years before
                moving to where I currently reside, Iowa.</p>
            <p>After moving to Iowa, I attended a vocational school that would teach me Heating, Ventilation, and Air
                Conditioning (HVAC). Before I could finish the program, I was recruited to join a local HVAC company
                where I worked for 3 years. At which time, I made the decision to join the local union. The idea of a
                group of like-minded individuals that were interested in producing the best possible work through high
                standards of craftmanship appealed very much to me. However, after 11 years in the trade, I realized I
                was not getting the challenge, pride, and satisfaction from the work as I once did. So, after careful
                thought, I made the decision to head back to school and carve a new path that would get back what I
                lost.</p>
            <p>In 2020 I enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University with my eyes set on an associate degree in
                science information technologies. In 2022 I earned said degree. Since then, I have been striving to
                learn, grow, and build my skills in the field that gave back to me the excitement, challenge, and
                satisfaction I was missing, coding/programming and web development.</p>
